Kubernetes Operators automate the creation, configuration, and management of 
instances of Kubernetes-native applications. A Kubernetes-native application 
is an application that is both deployed on Kubernetes and managed using the 
Kubernetes APIs and kubectl tooling.

The resources below cover information about what Operators are and how they 
work, as well as how to build Operators using the Operator Framework and 
Operator SDK.

### Self-Paced Learning
