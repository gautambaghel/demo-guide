GitOps workflows fit well with the DevOps methodologies. Part of this is
integration with current CI/CD pipelines. Using cloud native aware tools, such
as Tekton and Argo, can be used to create pipelines that are Kubernetes native.

## Video

This video demonstrates how to use Tekton for the CI part of your workflow
while using Argo for the CD aspect. It also goes over [Hive](https://github.com/
openshift/hive) for creating clusters.
