Enterprises see the benefit in using containerized applications to run their 
mission-critical workloads, but most IT organizations are not standardized on a 
single infrastructure stack. These heterogeneous environments often carry both 
Windows and Linux platforms, siloing applications and making it difficult for a 
business to modernize and scale their operations. The ideal world for customers 
is a singular container orchestration fabric that supports the two leading 
commercial operating systems in customer datacenters. Starting with OpenShift 
4.4, you can now run a Windows node and deploy Windows containers, side-by-side,
with you Linux containers.

## Video

This video demonstrates how to install a Windows node on AWS. It also goes over 
deploying a Windows container workload to the newly added node.
