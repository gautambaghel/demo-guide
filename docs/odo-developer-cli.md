`odo` is a CLI tool for developers who are writing, building, and deploying 
applications on OpenShift. With `odo`, developers get an opinionated CLI tool 
that supports fast, iterative development. `odo` abstracts away Kubernetes and 
OpenShift concepts so developers can focus on what's most important to them: 
code.

`odo` was created to improve the developer experience with OpenShift. Existing 
tools such as `oc` and `kubectl` are more operations-focused and require a 
deep understanding of Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts. `odo` is designed to 
be simple and concise so you can focus on coding rather than how to deploy 
your application. Since `odo` can build and deploy your code to your cluster 
immediately after you save your changes, you benefit from instant feedback and 
can validate your changes in real-time. `odo`'s syntax and design is centered 
around concepts already familiar to developers, such as project, application, 
and component.
