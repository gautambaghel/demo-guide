Using the pre-existing install process, also known as user provisioned
infrastructure or UPI, gives the administrator the ability to create and
manage OpenShift nodes themselves. The OpenShift install process changes when
using this method, where the Ignition configs must be provided to the nodes
so that they may cofigure and join the cluster. This manual install process
is needed if you need to perform an install in an environment with limited or
no access to the internet. For more information, refer to the [installer
documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/installing/inst
all_config/installing-restricted-networks-preparations.html).

## Blog

In this blog I will be going over how to perform an install in a lab
environment with restricted access to the Internet. I will also give an
overview of my environment, how to mirror the needed images, and any other
tips and tricks Iâ€™ve learned along the way.
